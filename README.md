# Dimensonality-Reduction-Techniques
Here i have used PCA (principal component analysis) and SVD (singular value decoposition) these techniques are used for solving curse of dimensionality and atlast i have also plotted curve of error after reconstruction of matrix in which we can see how error keeps on reducing after increasing no. of eigen vectors
